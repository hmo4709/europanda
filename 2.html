    <h2>Jerk Chicken Wings 레시피</h2>
    <img src="chix1.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>These didn't get the Week Wing honor due to any lack of deliciousness, but because
       I had already given grilled Jerk chicken its proper credit. However, there is virtue in a plate of Jerk wings over Jerk chicken.
       The essence of Jerk is the amazing mixture of herbs, spices, and chilies, and when it comes to wings over any other piece of chicken,
       the marinade-to-chicken ratio tips well in favor of the Jerk. That means more heat and more spice with just enough juicy chicken to temper
       the seasoning to the perfect amount.</P>
