    <h2>Pork Shoulder 레시피</h2>
    <img src="pork1.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Pork shoulder, also referred to as pork butt, starts out as a hulking mass of tough meat wrapped in a thick skin.
        This recipe starts the pork in a low oven for a leisurely eight-hour roast, resulting in spoonably tender meat.
        Then, we finish the shoulder off in a ripping hot 500°F oven to rapidly heat the skin until it's shatteringly crisp.</p>
    <P style="margin-top:45px;">If you want to serve your pork wit h a sauce, try making a pan sauce (see note),
         or pair it with sweet and spicy nuoc cham, Chinese style char siu, <a href="https://www.platingsandpairings.com/mojo-sauce/"
          target="_blank" title="Cuban Mojo">Cuban mojo</a>, a sweet Memphis-style barbecue sauce,
         or a bright Argentinian chimichurri. Or better yet, serve it with a whole selection.</P>
